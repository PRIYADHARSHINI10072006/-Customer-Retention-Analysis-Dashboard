CUSTOMER RETENTION ANALYSIS DASHBOARD
1. Introduction:
The telecom industry faces high customer attrition rates, which significantly impact revenue and long-term business growth. This project focuses on analyzing customer churn patterns using Microsoft Power BI to identify key risk factors and recommend data-driven retention strategies.
The analysis is based on the IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset containing 7,043 customer records. The dataset was transformed and modeled into a multi-page interactive dashboard to derive meaningful business insights.
2. Pricing Sensitivity Insight:
The analysis reveals that customer churn increases noticeably when monthly charges exceed $80. This indicates strong price sensitivity among high-paying customers and highlights the importance of value perception and pricing strategies in customer retention.
3. Tools and Technologies Used:
The following tools and technologies were utilized in this project:
Power BI Desktop – Development of a multi-page interactive dashboard, including page navigation and bookmarks.
Power Query – Data cleaning, transformation, and ETL processes.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Creation of calculated measures such as churn rate and implementation of conditional logic.
Data Modeling – Creation of Tenure Groups to enable structured drill-down analysis.

5. Dashboard Overview:
The dashboard is divided into three major analytical sections:
5.1 Executive Summary:
Provides a high-level overview for management, highlighting key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total customers, churn rate, and primary churn drivers.
5.2 Demographics and Drill-Down Analysis:
This section provides detailed insights into customer profiles based on:
Gender
Senior Citizen Status

A drill-down feature enables analysis of tenure groups and further breakdown into individual tenure months for deeper understanding.
5.3 Services and Account Analysis:
This section investigates how service subscriptions and billing preferences influence customer retention, including:
Internet Services
Tech Support
Streaming Services
Billing and Payment Methods:
6. Strategic Recommendations
Based on the analytical findings, the following retention strategies are recommended:
6.1 Targeted Migration Strategy:
Offer a 15% discount to customers on Month-to-Month contracts to encourage migration to 1-Year contracts, thereby reducing volatility.
6.2 Auto-Pay Incentive Program:
Provide a one-time bill credit to customers who switch from Electronic Check to Credit Card Auto-Pay, reducing payment-related churn.
6.3 High-Value Customer Retention Plan:
Introduce a “Price Lock” guarantee for loyal customers paying more than $80 per month to enhance trust and long-term retention.
